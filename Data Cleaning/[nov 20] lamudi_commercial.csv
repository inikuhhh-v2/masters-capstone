Project : Aspire Tower
City : E. Rodriguez Jr. Ave corner Calle Industria, Quezon City
Unit : Office Space
Ground Floor Size: 99 sqm

2nd Floor Size: 1,023 sqm
Parking: Inclusive of 9 Parking Slots 
Selling Price : From Php 185,000,000.00 Down to Php 168,000,000.00 Gross

Property Description:
A paragon of modern workspace design, this spacious office perfectly exemplifies the philosophy of form-following-function that effectively addresses the diverse and vital needs and preferences of contemporary organizations.

Occupants and guests are welcomed through its commercial lobby – an exclusive entrance signifying stature with its broad wall and high ceiling. Upon entry, a predominantly open layout places emphasis on collaborative conditions that foster communication and engagement crucial to better productivity. Balance is achieved with well-placed cubicles, enclosed conference rooms, and glass partitions that channel more intensive activity. Overall well-being is also given priority with rejuvenation areas that have been the hallmark of progressive working spaces.

The refined interior design imbues the space with an atmosphere of structure and dynamism with a restrained monochromatic palette and touches of complementary colors accenting the ceilings and walls. An eye-catching feature is the state-of-the-art air conditioning system as well, consisting of ceiling-mounted Samsung 360 Cassette units that disperse cool air evenly across a wider area and providing unparalleled comfort. No element is amiss in this environment suited to operations geared towards optimal performance and outstanding achievements.

Located on the world-class Aspire Tower at Nuvo District, its address on the corner of Calle Industria and C5 Road gives it strategic access to Quezon City, Marikina City, Pasig City, and Mandaluyong City. Business districts such as Ortigas Center and Bonifacio Global City (BGC) are also minutes away. Currently tenanted, this office space is a great source of rental income and a valuable addition to your investment portfolio!

Selling Price : From Php 185,000,000.00 Down to Php 168,000,000.00 Gross

Property Description:
A paragon of modern workspace design, this spacious office perfectly exemplifies the philosophy of form-following-function that effectively addresses the diverse and vital needs and preferences of contemporary organizations.

Occupants and guests are welcomed through its commercial lobby – an exclusive entrance signifying stature with its broad wall and high ceiling. Upon entry, a predominantly open layout places emphasis on collaborative conditions that foster communication and engagement crucial to better productivity. Balance is achieved with well-placed cubicles, enclosed conference rooms, and glass partitions that channel more intensive activity. Overall well-being is also given priority with rejuvenation areas that have been the hallmark of progressive working spaces.

The refined interior design imbues the space with an atmosphere of structure and dynamism with a restrained monochromatic palette and touches of complementary colors accenting the ceilings and walls. An eye-catching feature is the state-of-the-art air conditioning system as well, consisting of ceiling-mounted Samsung 360 Cassette units that disperse cool air evenly across a wider area and providing unparalleled comfort. No element is amiss in this environment suited to operations geared towards optimal performance and outstanding achievements.

Located on the world-class Aspire Tower at Nuvo District, its address on the corner of Calle Industria and C5 Road gives it strategic access to Quezon City, Marikina City, Pasig City, and Mandaluyong City. Business districts such as Ortigas Center and Bonifacio Global City (BGC) are also minutes away. Currently tenanted, this office space is a great source of rental income and a valuable addition to your investment portfolio!

Higher income yields – commercial properties generally show a greater level of income for a given property value, when compared to residential property. 2. Capital growth potential is based on income growth potential and other measurable factors – commercial properties are often valued on the basis of the potential (and actual) rental return being achieved. Other relevant factors include economic activity, interest rates, and the commercial success of the area surrounding the property. 3. Stability and consistency of income – longer leases. Whilst residential properties are typically held on short leases (often 12 months), commercial properties typically attract longer lease terms between three and 10 years, providing consistent and predictable income streams over time. 4. Income growth – the longer leases of commercial properties usually allow for the rent to increase in every year of the lease, thus increasing the return on investment as the lease progresses. 5. Maintenance – unlike residential investors, commercial investors have the potential to earn enhanced profit, with the lessee responsible for paying the cost of maintenance, rates and repairs on the property when the ongoing expenses are written into the commercial lease agreement.

Named for President Manuel Luis Quezon, who selected the site (formerly a private estate) in 1939, it officially replaced Manila as the capital in 1948. Considered part of Metropolitan Manila, the city began to grow after World War II (1939–45) with the construction of government buildings on Capitol Site. Many functions of national government remained in Manila, however, and the seat of government moved back to Manila in 1976. Light industry has developed along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, a circular road that links Quezon City to other suburbs, and large resettlement housing projects have been built there for low-income government workers. San Francisco del Monte and Kamuning are wealthy residential sectors, and Cubao is the transportation junction, bazaar area, and site of Araneta Coliseum. The University of the Philippines (1908) and the Ateneo de Manila University (a Jesuit institution dating from 1859) are in the city. Other points of interest include Father Aguilar’s Zoo, the National Park and Wildlife Grounds, and the Quezon Memorial Hall. Inc.

Quezon City is located on the Guadalupe Plateau, just northeast of Manila, in the Philippines. Quezon Memorial Circle, in the city center, is dominated by an art deco–style memorial to former president Manuel L. Quezon. The surrounding gardens contain playgrounds, fountains and the World Peace Bell monument. Ninoy Aquino Parks and Wildlife Center is a zoo and botanical garden, with a lagoon, crocodiles and peacocks. in addition to the eight vast estates the Philippine government purchased for this purpose. It was officially proclaimed as the national capital on October 12, 1949, and several government departments and institutions moved out of Manila and settled into the new capital city. This necessitated the expansion of the city northwards, carving out Novaliches from Caloocan which divided it into two non-contiguous parts. Several barrios were also taken from San Mateo and parts of Montalban. However, on June 24, 1976, Presidential Decree 940 was enacted, which reverted back to Manila the status of being the national capital while the whole of Metro Manila was designated as the seat of government.",N/A,N/A,N/A,commercial,"commercial, warehouse",https://www.lamudi.com.phhttps://www.lamudi.com.ph/buy/metro-manila/quezon-city/commercial-property-for-sale-840sqm-lot-area-quezon-city-narciso-realty/,CO624172A83015CPH,"121.0443089, 14.6621443",180,N/A,False

Named for President Manuel Luis Quezon, who selected the site (formerly a private estate) in 1939, it officially replaced Manila as the capital in 1948. Considered part of Metropolitan Manila, the city began to grow after World War II (1939–45) with the construction of government buildings on Capitol Site. Many functions of national government remained in Manila, however, and the seat of government moved back to Manila in 1976. Light industry has developed along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, a circular road that links Quezon City to other suburbs, and large resettlement housing projects have been built there for low-income government workers. San Francisco del Monte and Kamuning are wealthy residential sectors, and Cubao is the transportation junction, bazaar area, and site of Araneta Coliseum. The University of the Philippines (1908) and the Ateneo de Manila University (a Jesuit institution dating from 1859) are in the city. Other points of interest include Father Aguilar’s Zoo, the National Park and Wildlife Grounds, and the Quezon Memorial Hall.

Brand New 8-Storey Commercial Building for Sale in Tomas Morato, QC

*** For BUYERS ONLY ***

Welcome to Quezon City!

Named for President Manuel Luis Quezon, who selected the site (formerly a private estate) in 1939, it officially replaced Manila as the capital in 1948. Considered part of Metropolitan Manila, the city began to grow after World War II (1939–45) with the construction of government buildings on Capitol Site. Many functions of national government remained in Manila, however, and the seat of government moved back to Manila in 1976.
Light industry has developed along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, a circular road that links Quezon City to other suburbs, and large resettlement housing projects have been built there for low-income government workers. San Francisco del Monte and Kamuning are wealthy residential sectors, and Cubao is the transportation junction, bazaar area, and site of Araneta Coliseum. The University of the Philippines (1908) and the Ateneo de Manila University (a Jesuit institution dating from 1859) are in the city. Other points of interest include Father Aguilar’s Zoo, the National Park and Wildlife Grounds, and the Quezon Memorial Hall. Inc.

"Building For Sale in Diliman, Quezon City, Metro Manila",75290000,"Diliman, Quezon City","Code: MP-CP  Brand New 4-Storey Commercial Space for Sale in Tomas Morato, QC  *** For BUYERS ONLY ***  Welcome to Quezon City!  Named for President Manuel Luis Quezon, who selected the site (formerly a private estate) in 1939, it officially replaced Manila as the capital in 1948. Considered part of Metropolitan Manila, the city began to grow after World War II (1939–45) with the construction of government buildings on Capitol Site. Many functions of national government remained in Manila, however, and the seat of government moved back to Manila in 1976. Light industry has developed along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, a circular road that links Quezon City to other suburbs, and large resettlement housing projects have been built there for low-income government workers. San Francisco del Monte and Kamuning are wealthy residential sectors, and Cubao is the transportation junction, bazaar area, and site of Araneta Coliseum. The University of the Philippines (1908) and the Ateneo de Manila University (a Jesuit institution dating from 1859) are in the city. Other points of interest include Father Aguilar’s Zoo, the National Park and Wildlife Grounds, and the Quezon Memorial Hall.

At an average lease rate of say Php400 psm, potential monthly and annual revenue at 100% occupancy should be about Php8.21 Million and Php98.48 Million, respectively.

At an average lease rate of say Php400 psm, potential monthly and annual revenue at 100% occupancy should be about Php8.21 Million and Php98.48 Million, respectively.

At an average lease rate of say Php400 psm, potential monthly and annual revenue at 100% occupancy should be about Php8.21 Million and Php98.48 Million, respectively.
